# Starship Project

1. Create the three models by hardcoding them and show them on view (use classes to create the models from the hardcoded objects)
2. Implement an input module to be able to create the ships from user keyboard input
3. Create three buttons on every model for the [start engine, take off, land] methods
4. When you are all done try to refactor your code to make it as reusable as possible
	* Have one method for creating the models
	* Have one method for display
	* etc... you get the idea

### Tips and bonuses
* use classes to create the models (think of the common properties - don't repeat yourself)
* use bootstrap for the view, we dont have to reimagine what's already done
* think of what you have learned on this academy so far and try to implement as much of that knowledge as possible
* try not to use tables
* make some kind of validation for the inputs
* create a dynamic view, created from the models keys and values and try to make them more human readable i.e. cargoCapacity = Cargo Capacity
* ask questions :)
